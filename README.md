# Some mail

An experimental email client based on notmuch, along with other utilities like
afew and offlineimap.

A lot of inspiration comes from [Astroid](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid),
but I do want some more UI.


# Goals
I'm aiming for a nice and full-featured UI, but it should be fully operable with the keyboard.
All settings should be stored in easily readable/editable config files, so you
can centralize them in your dotfiles.
